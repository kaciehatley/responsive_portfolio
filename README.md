# Responsive Portfolio
Responsive coding portfolio

# Description

This portfolio was created with the intention of displaying my coding projects in a convenient format for employers. 

I initially created this portfolio using basic HTML and CSS. This version of my portfolio was created using Bootstrap components. I can see how Boostrap makes the experience easier for a user familiar with the documentation; however, for a newbie such as myself, I think I made it MUCH harder than it needed to be.

When viewing my portfolio, you may notice a few challenges I faced. Firstly, my header is responsive BUT the logo hides the navbar when the size of the browser is reduced. Additionally, my background does not extend to the bottom of the contact.html page, but does on all of the other pages. With Google-Fu and troubleshooting, I was able to fix several (but not all) issues.

This portfolio contains three HTML files and two CSS files. It explains who I am as an aspiring coder, displays a gallery of my projects, and allows viewers to contact me directly.

In the future, I would like to fix the errors mentioned above and add javascipt to enhance the users' experience.
