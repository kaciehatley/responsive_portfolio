            <p>Hello! My name is Kacie Hatley. I am an aspiring developer currently enrolled at the UNC Charlotte Coding Bootcamp. I anticipate to graduate in April 2020.</p>                
            <p>My background is in elementary education. After graduating from Wingate University in 2016, I taught 1st grade for one year and then became a 4-H youth development agent for NC State University. I love teaching and inspiring others to learn. Currently my job requires me to administer relevant youth development programs from kids ages 5-18.</p>
            <p>When the Department of Labor published its statistics for projected growth in the developer job market, I knew we needed a kids programming class in our community. After an exhausting and disappointing search for a volunteer teacher with a backgrounf in coding, I decided to learn it myself. I have been leading a coding club since January 2019, learning with the kids as we go. Currently I go into schools to introduce coding concepts with Scratch projects. I also lead an afterschool 4-H Club where kids use Scratch and basic Python to manipulate a raspberry pi.</p>
            <p>My long-term goal is to gain some experience in the coding world and gain enough knowledge to mentor/teach others. Bottom line, I want to help people.</p>
            <p>When I am not coding or keeping the tiny humans alive, you might find me rock-climbing, reading, traveling, or playing bluegrass music.</p>
